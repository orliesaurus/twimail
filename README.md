*THIS HACK IS WORK IN PROGRESS*

##Emails to Twilio and back

#Pre Install Requirements
- [This library by charlierguo](https://github.com/charlierguo/gmail)
- Python 2.7+
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

#Why this?
Sometimes you're in a different country with no wi-fi for a few hours or days and you still want to see if there are any crucial emails that you want to inspect

#What does it do?
The idea is that once every 6 hours with a CRONJOB this script will allow you to receive one or more SMSs with the titles of all your new emails

If you want to read an email you reply to the SMS with a number and you can get the full body of the email back.

Simple right?
